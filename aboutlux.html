				This installation responds to the question of how existing systems harm or help us. The approach is to represent the frustration, shame, messiness, disruption, and blurred boundaries that comes along with working from home. These themes are revealed in the objects that make up the intimate space of the work-from-home office. The installation will be a makeshift home office that features elements of the artistsâ€™ own space (half-eaten snacks, non-ergonomic chairs, eyedrops, cups and mugs, sticky notes, pillows, etc). <br>
