				<em>Understand/Understood: Krish Dineshkumar</em> <br>
				Playing on the idea of a sound bath, this installation is a meditation on what it means to listen, but not to hear. The blending of incoherent conversations, and metronomic waves asks the question: what care do we lose sight (or sound) of, when caught in the ebbs and flows of oppressive systems.This installation is made up of audio recordings of conversations had with members of the South Etobicoke community, melodized and manipulated by use of digital synthesizers and effects. <br>
