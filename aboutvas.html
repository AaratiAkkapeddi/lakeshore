				<em>Installation II: Vasuki Shanmuganathan</em> <br>
				The contents of small glass jars represent substances we wash away, hide, let decay, try to get rid of, or forget about in the intimacies of our home. A collection of conduits of care transmitted and received as represented by those most in touch with us around South Etobicoke. Be it the cleaner’s supplies keeping hotel rooms sanitized, water puddles on the bathroom floor after a redeeming shower, the factory worker’s hands washing away oily residue, a parent’s night sweats of worry, the wet sponge you squeezed hard because it was too much, grease from a kitchen, melted gelato but once enjoyed after a long shift, a teenager’s tears from friendships lost and found, or dried toothpaste from the day, you exhausted, wondered if it all mattered anymore.
