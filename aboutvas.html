				Glass jars displayed in a small wooden curio contain substances we wash away, hide, let decay, try to get rid of, or forget about in the intimacies of our home. Conduits of care transferred and received as represented by those most in touch with us in South Etobicoke. Be it the cleaner’s supplies used to disinfect hotel rooms, water puddles on the bathroom floor after a redeeming shower, the factory worker hands holding oily residue, a parent’s night sweats of worry, the wet sponge you squeezed hard because it was too much, grease from a kitchen, melted gelato but once enjoyed after a long shift, a teenager’s tears from friendships lost, or dried toothpaste from the day, you exhausted, wondered if it all mattered anymore.<br>
